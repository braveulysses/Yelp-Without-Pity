Obnoxious Yelp reviewers getting you down?  **Yelp Without Pity** is a Safari 5 extension that will hide those jerks forever.

## Status ##

This is a work in progress, and is not quite ready for use.

Ongoing problems:

* Security error occurs when creating local SQL database. See [this Apple support discussion](http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2457408).
* Audio support seems sketchy. I'll probably remove it.
